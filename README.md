Length:                                     4   pages,   including visuals
Purpose:                            The purpose   of this   assessment   is   to   engage with   stakeholders   from   diverse
sectors,   industries, and disciplines to co-create potential   regenerative futures
Interview synthesis:   Regenerative futures
In this assessment, you will undertake three interviews   with   different   stakeholders   to   explore their perspectives on regenerative action. After   conducting the   interviews,   you   need   to   create   a   4-page document that draws out the main   insights   from   the   stakeholders,   synthesises   the   ideas and   highlights   potential directions for regenerative action. While   this   is   an   individual   assessment, the insights you generate will be   used to   support   your   group   project   for   Assessment   3.
Requirements
You create a document that   utilises text and visuals   to   cover   the   following:
1.       One   page on each stakeholder   (3   pages   total)   –   Why   did   you   choose   them?   What   were the   main   insights from the conversation? What are key   quotes   that   stood   out?         How do they think, feel, and act   in   respect   to your   problem   space?
2.       One-page overview of the key   takeaways   -   What   do   the   insights   mean for   your   group   project?   Do they align with your team’s   understanding of the problem   space?   Do they
enrich your understanding and give further detail?   Does   it challenge   your   assumptions   and offer alternative ways of thinking about the problem?   Does   it   suggest   some   further   steps or areas of investigation   that you   haven’t   explored yet with   your   team?
How to go   about   itThis assignment will help you gain a   real-world   understanding   of the   domain   of   regenerative   action your team   is exploring and assist   in co-creating   regenerative futures with   community      members.
Step   1 -   Develop an interview   guide
-                Develop an interview   guide with   open-ended   questions   to   help   you   explore   the   perspectives of different stakeholders on the sustainability   problem,   potential regenerative actions and possible   imaginaries of the   future.
-                We recommend   having six to ten   open-ended   questions for   the   interview.
-                You should create specific   probes that   help you to   explore   responses   in   greater   depth.
-                You should gain feedback from your teammates   on the   interview   guide   and   questions.
-                We will also conduct a   practice   interview   in   class   in the   seminar   activity.
-                After the practice interview, you   should   reflect   on which   questions   worked well   and   which were unclear
Step 2 -   Reach out to   interview   participants
-                Identify which ‘types’ of stakeholders   you   might   want   to   interview   by   reflecting   on   the   system   mapping activities.
-                Brainstorm with   your team about   potential   people that   you   or   your friends,   classmates,   and family   might   know who fit these ‘types’   .
-                If you do   not   have contacts   with   these ‘types’,   you   may   need   to   contact   people   directly   through   LinkedIn or email.
-                When reaching out to   potential   interviewees,   give   a   simple ‘ask’:   For   example
o    “My name is X,   I am a student at   UTS   conducting research   on   Y.   Given your      work/activities   with ABC,   I   would love to interview   you about your   perspective   on DEF. Please let me know if   you   would be free for a 30-minute   interview
between [these dates]. Let me know if   you   would   prefer to do the interview in person   or   over   Zoom.   ”
-                Once an interviewee   agrees,   send   a   calendar   invitation for   the   interview,   including   the   meeting location or the   Zoom   link.
Step   3 - Conduct   the   int代 写95003 Sustainability in an Interconnected World Assessment 2C/C++
代做程序编程语言erviews
-                You should aim to   conduct   interviews   of 20 to   30   minutes.
-                At the start of the interview,   introduce yourself   and   ask   permission   to   record.
-                During the interview,   follow your   interview   guide   but   try   to   create   a   conversational   tone.
-                Be sure to   probe and   maintain   control   in   the   interview   to   keep   things   on   track.
-                Take   interpretative   notes during and right   after   the   interview   to   ensure   you   have   captured your initial   impressions.
-                After your first   interview,   reflect on what went well and what   you   might   change   for   future   interviews.
Step   4 - Analyse   and   synthesise   insights   from   the   interviews
-                Re-read your   interpretative   notes for   each   interview.
-                Use the   in-built transcript. function   in   Zoom   or   utilise   a   speech-to-text   service   (such   as   Otter.ai) to transcribe your interview   recording   to   text.
-                Analyse the interview transcripts   (either by   reading/or   reading while   listening)
o   As you   read/listen,   highlight any   key quotes that shed   light on   the   sustainability   problem or potential for   regenerative action
-                As you analyse/listen, write/type your own analytical   reflections   on what   you   heard.
-                Remember, analysing   interviews   is   more than just summarising what   participants
described, you   need to interpret their comments with a   critical   lens   and   synthesise what   the differing   perspectives offered   from each interviewee.
Note:   This is an individual assignment, meaning you should be   doing   the   work independently,   but you can get feedback and ideas from your team as you develop your questions   and identify   participants. Also, note that the interviewees must be   unique   to   each   team   member (i.e. you   can’t interview the same person as someone in your team).
